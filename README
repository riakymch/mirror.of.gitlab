Idea is to test mirroing of this empty project from gitlab to github

The procedure is as follows
 1. I imported the gitlab repo to github

 2. In the project of gitlab I went to Settings->Repository->Mirroring
   Repositories

 3. As git repository URL I inserted "ssh://git@github.com/<group>/<repo>.git

 4. I Detected the host keys

 5. Changed Authentification from Password to SSH Public Key and "Pressed
   Mirror repository"

 6. Then I copied the created ssh key from mirrored repository -> button on
   the right hand side

 7. In the Github repo I went to Settings->Deploy Keys and added the deploy
   key (SSH key created by gitlab)
